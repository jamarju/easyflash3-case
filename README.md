Designed for extra printability. Just print the STLs with the outer sides laying on the printbed (you might need to rotate the top side 180ยบ).

Recommended settings:

- 3 mm brim and/or heated bedto avoid cornerwarp
- 0.3 mm layer height or thinner for higher detail
- 20% infill

Use a 16 x 3 mm countersunk screw to secure the parts together.
